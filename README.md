# CGV_PROJECT_StorySimulation_ThirstyCrow
This Project is on “Story Simulation” Computer Graphics using OpenGL Functions. It is a User interactive program where in the User can view the required display by making use of the input devices like Keyboard and Mouse. Various options such as reset, toggle water level is provided. The user can choose the desired option. It has a very simple and effective user interface.To implement the Scientific computer simulation of the story with the computational model we are using OpenGL framework, different primitives and various functions available in OpenGL
